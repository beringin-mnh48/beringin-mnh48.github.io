## Affixes

These are used to mark the affixes that exist in Malay and Indonesian languages. It is also possible to be typed out without using these markers but it will take more spaces as Malay and Indonesian uses affixes heavily.

Sample word: mempertanggungjawabkannya (meaning: to make someone to be responsible of something by the person being mentioned about) which has combination of one circumfix, meN-…-kan (making noun into verb and mark it as present tense), one prefix, per- (making the object as a subject); and one suffix, -nya (marking the action to be from the person being mentioned about). Instead of typing out each letters for the affixes, you can just type in one letter for each of them.

In this sample, it would end up as <span class="brgnword">MRtaGguGjawabNX</span> (15&nbsp;letters) when written with affix letters mixed in instead of <span class="brgnword">mEmpErtaGguGjawabkanYa</span> (22&nbsp;letters) using basic letters alone for the same word. Note that it is written horizontally here just for the sake of comparison, it must be written vertically when writing it the proper way.

| Actual letter | What you type | Affixes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| M | M | meN- |
| D | D | di- |
| P | P | peN- |
| S | S | se- |
| B | B | ber- |
| T | T | ter- |
| R | R | per- |
| K | K | ke- |
| A | A | -an|
| N | N | -kan |
| H | H | -kah |
| L | L | -lah |
| X | X | -nya |
{: .substltr}

Some of the affixes in Indonesian and Malay are spelt as is and will not have dedicated letter:
- Suffix -i will use Beringin Vowel I
- Closing of the circumfix me-…-i, mem-…-i, men-…-i, meng-…-i, meny-…-i, memper-…-i, di-…-i, diper-…-i, per-…-i will all use Beringin Vowel I
- Infix -el-, -em-, -er-, will be spelt as is because it is now considered as part of the word that got affixed instead of real affixes
- Other affixes will be spelt in full, this includes the prefix maha-, pasca-, pra-, eka-, bi-, dwi-, anti-, pro-, tata-, juru-, swa- and others
