## Introduction

You can write Beringin by using normal Latin-based keyboard. This is done by assigning specific Latin letter to specific Beringin letter based on the [table here](latin-table.html) and by using the specified font from [here](../mnh48-beringin/en) that will display Beringin letters in place of Latin letters.

Pros:
- Easy to use
- Don't need to memorize that much of custom binding

Cons:
- Need to mix different fonts if you want to display both Beringin and Latin in the same sentence, this poses problem for certain software where only one font is allowed to be used on the whole instance

In all of the example words below, they are displayed horizontally just so that it do not disturb the word flow in the English sentence. Beringin is actually written vertically from top to bottom, right to left.


### Lowercase Latin

Lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet always correspond to the same reading as the basic Beringin alphabet. Typing the lowercase Latin letter `m` will display the Beringin letter EHM (<span class="brgn">m</span>) which carries the same sound as the Latin letter M in Malay and Indonesian languages (IPA: /m/). Typing `j` gives you JEH (<span class="brgn">j</span>) with sound of J (IPA: /dʒ/), typing `z` gives you ZEHT (<span class="brgn">z</span>) with sound of Z (IPA: /z/), etc.

Example:
1. Lowercase Latin letters `merah`:
  - results: <span class="brgnwordlist">merah</span> (letter EHM, vowel EH, letter EHR, vowel A, letter ESH)
  - spelling in in Latin script: merah
  - reading: "may-ruh" (IPA: /me.rah/)
  - meaning: the colour "red"
2. Lowercase Latin letters `pagi`:

#### Covering the Additional Letters

Typing `G` gives you letter ENG (<span class="brgn">G</span>) with sound of NG (IPA: /ŋ/), typing `Y` gives you letter NYE (<span class="brgn">Y</span>) with sound of NY (IPA: /ɲ/), etc.

### Punctuation Marks

Punctuation marks on the Latin keyboard has two functions in regard to using it to display Beringin alphabet. Some of the punctuation mark existing on Latin keyboard are assigned to the equivalent marks in Beringin alphabet, some are assigned for different marks, and some are assigned for additional letters that could not be matched by uppercase Latin letters as specified in the table [linked earlier](latin-table.html).


#### Covering the Equivalent Punctuation Marks

There are Beringin punctuation marks that correspond to what is available on Latin keyboard layout, and these were assigned as such.  Typing the mark `.` will display the beringin period (<span class="brgn">.</span>). Typing `?` gives you question mark (<span class="brgn">?</span>), typing `-` gives you hyphen (<span class="brgn">-</span>).


#### Covering the Non-Equivalent Punctuation Marks

There are also Beringin punctuation marks that does not directly correspond to any Latin mark on the keyboard, as such it could not be directly assigned and uses different marks instead. Typing the mark `<` will display the beringin opening double quote (<span class="brgn">&lt;</span>). Typing `]` gives you closing single quote (<span class="brgn">\]</span>), typing `"` gives you word duplication mark (<span class="brgn">\"</span>).


#### Covering Additional Non-Native Letters

There are additional non-native Beringin letters that could not be assigned to the uppercase Latin letters as all of them were used up, as such they were assigned to currently unused space on the punctuation mark slots instead as specified in the table [linked earlier](latin-table.html). Typing the mark `\` will display the beringin letter TRA (<span class="brgn">\\</span>) which carries the sound TR (IPA: /tɹ̝̊/). Typing `{` gives you letter TSA (<span class="brgn">{</span>) with sound of TS (IPA: /t͡s/), typing `'` gives you letter AK (<span class="brgn">\'</span>) with sound of glottal stop (IPA: /ʔ/), etc.
